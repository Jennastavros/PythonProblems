101 Graded Python Problems by Ilkka Kokkarinen

The problem specifications and the automated tester for the graded lab problems for the course CCPS 109 Computer Science I, as taught in Chang School of Continuing Education of Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.

Write the specified functions into a new file labs109.py. The automated tester will test only those functions that you have implemented, and run the tests in the order in which your functions appear in the file.

Some of the tests use the data files warandpeace.txt and words.txt as source data.
