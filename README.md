# 109 Python Problems for CCPS 109

The problem specifications and the automated tester for the graded lab problems for the course *CCPS 109 Computer Science I*, as taught by Ilkka Kokkarinen for the Chang School of Continuing Education of Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.

Write the specified functions one by one into the file `labs109.py`. The automated tester will test only those functions that you have implemented so far, and run the tests in the order in which your functions appear in the file.

Some of the tests use the UTF-8 text files `warandpeace.txt` and `words.txt` as data source. Do not edit or modify these files in any way, since doing so makes it impossible for the tester to produce the correct expected checksum for the function whose tester uses that text file.

Everyone who wishes to teach or learn Python is free to use and adapt these problems and the automated tester script as they see fit. These programs are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but **without any warranty**; without even the implied warranty of **merchantability** or **fitness for a particular purpose**.
