# 109 Python Problems for CCPS 109

The problem specifications and the automated tester for the graded lab problems for the course *CCPS 109 Computer Science I*, as taught by Ilkka Kokkarinen for the Chang School of Continuing Education of Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.

Write the specified functions one by one into the file `labs109.py`. The automated tester will test only those functions that you have implemented so far, and run the tests in the order in which your functions appear in the file.

Some of the tests use the UTF-8 text files `warandpeace.txt` and `words.txt` as data source. Editing these files in any way most likely makes it impossible for the tester to produce the correct expected checksum for the functions whose testers use that particular text file.

Everyone who wishes to teach or learn Python is welcome to use and adapt these problems and the automated tester script for their own purposes as they see fit. The lab specification document and the automated tester software `tester109.py` are released under the GNU Public License 3, with no warranties implied by the author. The rights for the text files `warandpeace.txt` and `words.txt` belong to their respective holders.
