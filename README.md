101 Graded Python Problems by Ilkka Kokkarinen

The problem specifications and the automated tester for the graded lab problems for the course CCPS 109 Computer Science I, as taught in Chang School of Continuing Education of Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.

Write the specified functions one by one into the file labs109.py. The automated tester will test only those functions that you have implemented so far, and run the tests in the order in which your functions appear in the file.

Some of the tests use the UTF-8 text files warandpeace.txt and words.txt as data source. Do not modify these files in anyway, since doing so makes it impossible for the tester to produce the correct expected checksum.
